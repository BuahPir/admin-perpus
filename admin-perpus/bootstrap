The file `/admin-perpus/admin-perpus/bootstrap` is not typically a file that would contain code or content in a Laravel project. The `bootstrap` directory usually contains files related to the framework's initialization and configuration. 

If you meant to create or modify a specific file within the `bootstrap` directory, please clarify which file you would like to work on or provide more details about what you want to achieve. If you need a new file created in a different directory, please specify that as well.
